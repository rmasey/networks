## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rmasey/networks/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

c) Network security and threats, use of firewalls, proxies and encryption.
     

Security Principle (CIA)
Threat
Ways to minimise threat
Confidentiality - Keeping data private
Brute force attack - attacker uses software to repeatedly try different passwords to gain access




Spyware

Phishing - a type of social engineering attack which involves getting a user to enter personal information via a fake website.




Pharming - involves modifying DNS entries (local by changing the hosts file or DNS server), which causes users to be directed to the wrong website when they visit a certain web address.  The aim is to capture user login credentials. To change local DNS, attackers  install malware.  Attackers take advantage of exploits in software that control DNS servers.

Packet sniffing/eavesdropping with software like WireShark where the attacker gathers packet data.  If traffic includes passing unencrypted passwords, an unauthorized individual can potentially access your accounts and read confidential data.





IP spoofing - creating IP packets with false source IP address for the purpose of impersonating another computer.  IP address spoofing is most frequently used in denial-of-service attacks, where the objective is to flood the target with an overwhelming volume of traffic, and the attacker does not care about receiving responses to the attack packets. Packets with spoofed IP addresses are more difficult to filter since each spoofed packet appears to come from a different address, and they hide the true source of the attack
Only allow three password attempts before account if locked
Use strong passwords
Use Captcha
Two factor authentication (like banks)

Anti-spyware

Ask users to select a personal image and display this user-selected image with any forms that request a password. 
Train staff so they recognize legitimate and suspicious emails and websites eg check URL for typos.

Install antivirus software, keep it updated and run daily.
Don't open dubious files that may contain malware




Use WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access - the encryption protocol that is used to secure Wi-Fi connections. It provides unique encryption keys for each wireless client that connects. 
Use only secure web connections (HTTPS)
Only accept SSL Certificate from trusted sources
Use a secure VPN (one that uses encryption) - see below
Don't use default password

Use a packet filtering firewall
Integrity - Preventing data modification
Man in the Middle Attack -  message integrity (so you know the message has not been tampered with)

SQL Injection (see https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp) 
Hashing, Digital signatures


Form Validation, Prepared Statements (with parameterized queries) as in your coursework!



Availability - Keeping your network services up and running
DoS and DDos Attacks


Malicious software or malware eg viruses and worms (have the ability to self-replicate by spreading copies of themselves, viruses rely on host files usually executable programs to replicate themselves whereas worms do not)
Packet filtering firewall
Auto patch updates

Anti-virus software, patch update,
Firewall
Train staff so they recognize legitimate and suspicious emails and websites.
